Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Premkumar, I completed  my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering. As I am in the procedure of finding the right job, I identified your company and find it the right place as I will have the scope of being a part of the technical team, where I can execute my Software knowledge, which is my area of interest.

I have been an active member of Hidden Ciphertext Attribute Based Encryption with Fast Decryption for PHRS & have got a practical knowledge during this project.

I would like to be a part of this reputed firm, where I can utilize my skills, knowledge & talent. This would be the right opportunity and I strongly believe that if given a chance I will prove myself and contribute to the growth & success of the organization.

Thank you for your consideration.

(T.Premkumar)
